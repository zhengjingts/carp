Cookie-based Amplification Repression Protocol
====================================

CARP is a light-weight cookie-based protocol for throttling amplification attack. It works on transport layer to replace UDP protocol. CARP's design makes it suitable for most UDP application scenarios, and still, it can mitigate attack efficiently.
